"""Acquisition filenames, taken apart.

A microscope filename carries the experiment's design in it --
``20260815_1_lysosensor_Y715C_0`` is date, dish, experiment, variant, field --
and every tool in this folder has to get that design back out before it can
group anything, color anything, or match a control to its own replicate.

**Nothing here guesses on one name alone.** Which position carries the
condition is only visible across the whole batch: one file cannot tell you that
part 3 is the thing that varies. So the split proposes a role per position and
the caller overrides any of them, and files with a different number of parts are
a separate *scheme* rather than being force-fitted -- silently assigning `date`
to a field-of-view number corrupts every date-matched comparison downstream, and
does it quietly.

The delimiter is a spec, not a character: ``"_ OR -"``, ``"_|-"`` and ``"_,-"``
each name two, and longest is tried first so ``"__ OR _"`` works.

Parsed columns are what the apps' overlays and replicate matching are built on
-- which column panels a plot, which value is the control, which columns a
control is matched on -- so they live here rather than in one app.

Only `re` and `pandas`; no plotting, no app.
