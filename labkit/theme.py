"""The one place any color in any of these apps is decided.

Everything here is red-on-gray: gray carries the interface, red means *you*
(selection, the active tab, the primary action, the thing being edited).  The
rule is worth stating because it is what keeps the accent readable -- if red
also meant "bad" or "channel 2" it would stop meaning "here".

Two palettes live here, and they are deliberately not the same:

``SCREEN``
    The interface, dark by default.  Tuned for a monitor in a dim microscope
    room.
``PRINT``
    What figures are drawn in.  Tuned for white paper: gray first, red second,
    and every series distinguishable after a grayscale photocopy, because
    reviewers still print things.

``css()`` renders SCREEN into the custom properties every app's stylesheet
reads, so a change here reaches all six interfaces, and ``PRINT`` feeds
``labkit.plots``, so it reaches every figure.
