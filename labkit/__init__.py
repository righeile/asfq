"""Shared parts of the lab's tools: one look, one file browser, one set of
plotting controls, one place p-values come from.

    from labkit import theme, plots, stats

* ``theme``   the red-on-gray palette, and the CSS every interface is built from
* ``plots``   the publication style, the three figures these tools make, and
              significance brackets
* ``stats``   the comparison engine the brackets read their numbers from
* ``browse``  filesystem listing, with adapters for Flask, FastAPI and stdlib
* ``names``   acquisition filenames taken apart: roles, schemes, the group label
* ``schemes`` saved colour schemes, shared by every app that draws a figure

``python -m labkit.sync`` copies the built assets into each app, so the apps
stay standalone and runnable on a machine that has never heard of labkit.
