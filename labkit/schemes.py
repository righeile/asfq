"""
Named colour schemes, saved once and offered by every one of these apps.

A scheme is a flat ``{series name: "#rrggbb"}`` map -- exactly what
:attr:`labkit.plots.PlotSpec.colours` holds -- kept under
``~/.labkit/colour_schemes``.  The store is shared between the tools on
purpose rather than split per app: "the KO is this red" is a decision about a
paper, and a paper's panels come out of four of these programs.

Keyed by name, not by position, so a scheme saved for a two-genotype figure
still puts the KO in the same red when a third genotype turns up between them.
